# Java-Snake-Code-Help
Hi all, I'm writing a program for a school project where i'm recreating the snake game. I followed a tutorial on YouTube but found that when I run the program, it simply displays a blank white window, not the desired interface. I wrote using java swing. Any help would be super appreciated, thanks!
